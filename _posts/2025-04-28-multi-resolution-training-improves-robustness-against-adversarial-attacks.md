title: Multi-resolution training improves robustness against adversarial attacks
description: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have progressed rapidly in recent years and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. They are now integral to critical tasks, such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous vehicles, where DNNs have become the primary method for handling most of the processing. However, many DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacksâ€”small but deliberately crafted perturbations applied to input data. Such perturbations can easily cause misclassification, posing significant risks, especially in autonomous vehicle systems. In this blog post, we present a novel approach called multi-resolution training, which utilizes lower-resolution information from input images to retain essential features while partially filtering out adversarial attacks. Our method involves designing CNN layers that apply various downsampling techniques with custom-designed filters, followed by upsampling to restore the resolution for further network processing. This approach has been tested on multiple DNNs, and results show that it effectively enhances the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks.

Recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, where small modifications to input data can result in incorrect predictions. This susceptibility arises from DNNs' inherent linearity in high-dimensional spaces and limited generalization. This vulnerability is especially concerning for traffic sign recognition systems, which rely exclusively on DNNs processing camera images without additional error correction sources. Many research efforts have been made on attacks targeting these systems, as they are particularly susceptible and easily exploited in real-world scenarios. Early research into adversarial attacks on traffic sign recognition typically involved physical methods, such as affixing stickers to traffic signs, replacing signs with versions that included embedded perturbations, or placing patches directly on camera lenses. While these methods can be effective, they require manual effort and are often noticeable to drivers. To address these limitations, researchers have shifted their focus to direct attacks on DNN inputs. One of the first developed techniques is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which uses the gradients of the loss function relative to the input data to create perturbations that maximize the loss and result in misclassification. Subsequent developments include the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) approach. Other significant adversarial algorithms are the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Papernot's attack, and the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack, all contributing to the evolving landscape of adversarial machine learning. Despite the proliferation of these attack methods, defense and mitigation strategies, particularly for traffic sign classification tasks, have received significantly less attention. The common approach to enhancing the robustness of DNNs is adversarial training, which involves incorporating adversarial attack samples into the training dataset. Training a model with only one or a limited range of adversarial examples leaves it susceptible to other types of attacks, necessitating the inclusion of diverse adversarial examples during training. Consequently, this approach is not universal and can demand significant training effort.

We propose a novel multi-resolution training approach  that enhances the DNN architecture by incorporating an additional CNN block before the main network. This block first downsamples traffic sign images to a lower resolution via decimation and then upsamples them back to their original resolution via interpolation for further processing by the network. The CNN block incorporates layers with filters designed using various downsampling techniques, such as low-pass filtering, Gaussian filtering, and median filtering. This method helps mitigate subtle attacks characterized by small, high-frequency perturbations while preserving the essential features of the original traffic signs, thereby enhancing the DNNs' robustness against adversarial attacks.

## Multi-resolution CNN block
The multi-resolution process is implemented through a custom-designed CNN block, which includes a downsampling CNN layer with multiple filter options, followed by a standard bilinear interpolation layer for upsampling.

The **first option** utilizes a simple 1D low-pass filter defined as $$h_\text{lp} = [\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}]$$, commonly used for its simplicity and effectiveness in smoothing operations, approximating a half-band low-pass filter. The corresponding 2D filter used in the `LP_conv` layer is computed as:

$$ h_\text{lp}[x, y] = h_\text{lp} \cdot h_\text{lp}^T, $$

resulting in a \(3 \times 3\) kernel:

$$
h_\text{lp} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{16} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{16} \\
\frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{8} \\
\frac{1}{16} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{16}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

This 2D filter effectively smooths input data, making it ideal for downsampling in the multi-resolution framework.

The **second option** is a Gaussian filter, which offers more customization and smoother outputs. The normalized 1D Gaussian filter is defined as:

$$
h_\text{g}(n) = \frac{\exp\left(-0.5 \left(\frac{n}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)}{\sum_{n} \exp\left(-0.5 \left(\frac{n}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)},
$$

where $$n$$ denotes the indices, represented as $$(\{-\frac{z-1}{2}, \ldots, 0, \ldots, \frac{z-1}{2}\}\)$$, $$z$$ is the filter size, and $${\sigma}$$ is the standard deviation, which controls the spread of the filter. The resulting 2D Gaussian filter applied in the `Gaussian_conv` layer is computed as:

$$ h_\text{g}[x, y] = h_\text{g} \cdot h_\text{g}^T $$

By adjusting the kernel size $$z$$ and the standard deviation $${\sigma}$$, the `Gaussian_conv` layer can achieve varying levels of smoothing, offering enhanced flexibility. This design ensures that the multi-resolution training framework adapts to different filtering needs while maintaining computational efficiency.


## Experiment

## Adversarial Attack
We deployed two adversarial attacks on the traffic signs including the FGSM attack and the patch attack. The FGSM attack is one of the earliest and most representative adversarial attack. It is considered as a white-box attack as it requires the prior knowdlege of the neural entwork structure, parameters and 
This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) 
that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now 
[on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).


## Images and Figures

Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you
might face losing important information in your blog post.
To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:

```markdown
{% raw %}{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}{% endraw %}
```

which results in the following image:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}

To ensure that there are no namespace conflicts, you must save your asset to your unique directory
`/assets/img/2025-04-28-[SUBMISSION NAME]` within your submission.

Please avoid using the direct markdown method of embedding images; they may not be properly resized.
Some more complex ways to load images (note the different styles of the shapes/shadows):

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/8.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/10.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/11.jpg" class="img-fluid"  %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/12.jpg" class="img-fluid" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/7.jpg" class="img-fluid" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Interactive Figures

Here's how you could embed interactive figures that have been exported as HTML files.
Note that we will be using plotly for this demo, but anything built off of HTML should work
(**no extra javascript is allowed!**).
All that's required is for you to export your figure into HTML format, and make sure that the file
exists in the `assets/html/[SUBMISSION NAME]/` directory in this repository's root directory.
To embed it into any page, simply insert the following code anywhere into your page.

```markdown
{% raw %}{% include [FIGURE_NAME].html %}{% endraw %} 
```

For example, the following code can be used to generate the figure underneath it.

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv')

fig = px.density_mapbox(
    df, lat='Latitude', lon='Longitude', z='Magnitude', radius=10,
    center=dict(lat=0, lon=180), zoom=0, mapbox_style="stamen-terrain")
fig.show()

fig.write_html('./assets/html/2025-04-28-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html')
```

And then include it with the following:

```html
{% raw %}<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ 'assets/html/2025-04-28-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="600px" width="100%"></iframe>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

Voila!

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ 'assets/html/2025-04-28-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="600px" width="100%"></iframe>
</div>

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow wellâ€‰â€”â€‰the authors are human and itâ€™s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw  %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers. You can try toggling it on or off yourself below:

{% highlight c++ %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Diagrams

This theme supports generating various diagrams from a text description using [jekyll-diagrams](https://github.com/zhustec/jekyll-diagrams){:target="\_blank"} plugin.
Below, we generate a few examples of such diagrams using languages such as [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/){:target="\_blank"}, [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/){:target="\_blank"}, [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/){:target="\_blank"}, etc.

**Note:** different diagram-generation packages require external dependencies to be installed on your machine.
Also, be mindful of that because of diagram generation the first time you build your Jekyll website after adding new diagrams will be SLOW.
For any other details, please refer to [jekyll-diagrams](https://github.com/zhustec/jekyll-diagrams){:target="\_blank"} README.

**Note:** This is not supported for local rendering! 

The diagram below was generated by the following code:

{% raw %}
```
{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    participant Alice
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
participant John
participant Alice
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}

## Blockquotes

<blockquote>
    We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally youâ€™ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body`-sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

***

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
â‹…â‹…* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
â‹…â‹…1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

â‹…â‹…â‹…You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

â‹…â‹…â‹…To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.â‹…â‹…
â‹…â‹…â‹…Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.â‹…â‹…
â‹…â‹…â‹…(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behavior, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered lists can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
